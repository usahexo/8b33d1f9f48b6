#  What are the best starting hands in poker?

There is no definitive answer to this question, as the best starting hand in poker depends on the exact variant of the game being played, and the particular situation. However, there are some hands that are generally considered to be more powerful than others, and understanding these hands is a key part of becoming a successful poker player.

In general, the strongest hands in poker are those that contain a combination of high cards and pairs. Aces and kings are both strong hands, as they contain two high cards each. Pairs such as queens and jacks are also very desirable, as they give players the chance to make two separate winning hands. Other powerful combinations include three-of-a-kind and a straight flush.

While it is important to know which hands are strong, it is also important to be aware of which hands are weak. In general, hands that contain low cards or no pairs are weak, as there is a higher chance that these hands will not win any substantial pots. It is therefore important for players to be aggressive when holding these weaker hands, in order to bluff other players into folding.

 Understanding which starting hands are strong and which ones are weak is an essential part of becoming a successful poker player. By knowing which hands to play and which ones to fold, players can increase their chances of winning pots and making profits at the table.

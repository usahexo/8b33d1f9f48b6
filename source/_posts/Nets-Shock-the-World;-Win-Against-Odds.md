#  Nets Shock the World; Win Against Odds

In a major upset, the Nets defeated the Warriors 111-102 in Game 7 of the Western Conference Semifinals. The Nets were heavy underdogs, with odds of +7000 to win the series according to OddsShark.

This improbable victory marks the first time in NBA history that a team has come back from being down 3-1 in a playoff series to win. It also means that the Nets will be advancing to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 2002.

The Nets were led by their star player, Kevin Durant, who had an incredible performance in this game. Durant finished with 41 points, 11 rebounds, and 8 assists, becoming only the second player ever (the other being LeBron James) to score at least 40 points in a Game 7 of a playoff series.

Other key contributors for the Nets include D’Angelo Russell (24 points) and Jarrett Allen (15 points, 10 rebounds). For the Warriors, Stephen Curry led the way with 34 points, but no other player scored more than 13 points. Klay Thompson was particularly ineffective in this game, scoring just 6 points on 2-of-11 shooting from the field.

The Warriors had been favored to win this series heading into Game 7, but they were ultimately undone by their poor shooting and lack of contributions from other players beyond Curry. The Nets were able to take advantage and pull off the upset victory.

Now they will move on to face either the Nuggets or Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. No one is giving them much of a chance against either of those teams, but they have already proven that they are capable of upsetting anyone in this playoffs.

#  Nets Pull Off Crazy Comeback Over Lakers

Down by as many as 25 points in the third quarter, the Brooklyn Nets staged a furious comeback to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers 112-104.

D’Angelo Russell led the way for Brookyln with 28 points on 10-of-22 shooting, while Jarrett Allen chipped in with 18 points and 14 rebounds.

LeBron James had a triple-double for the Lakers with 24 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the deficit.

Brooklyn got off to a hot start, jumping out to an early 16-point lead in the first quarter. But the Lakers came roaring back in the second quarter, outscoring Brooklyn 33-16 to take a 57-52 halftime lead.

The Lakers continued their momentum into the third quarter, going up by as many as 25 points before Brooklyn finally started to rally. The Nets went on a 37-12 run to finish the quarter and take a 89-88 lead into the fourth.

Brooklyn was able to maintain their lead in the fourth quarter, eventually winning by eight points.

It was an impressive win for Brooklyn, who have now won three of their last four games. The Lakers, on the other hand, have now lost three of their last four games.

#  Philadelphia 76ers vs Brooklyn Nets: Betting Preview

The Philadelphia 76ers (27-25) visit the Brooklyn Nets (22-30) on Wednesday night. Philly is coming off a home win over the Miami Heat, while the Nets are fresh off a loss to the Houston Rockets.

The 76ers opened as 2-point road favorites with a total of 224 points. The moneyline has shifted since then, with Philly now -1.5 away favorites.

This game features two of the more exciting young teams in the NBA. Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid have led the 76ers resurgence, while D’Angelo Russell and Caris LeVert have led the Nets resurgence.

The 76ers come into this game winners of 9 of their last 12 games. The Nets come into this game losers of 7 of their last 10 games. However, six of those seven losses came against teams currently in playoff positions (Houston, Toronto, Milwaukee, Boston, Oklahoma City, Indiana).

Offensively, these two teams are very evenly matched. The Nets rank 8th in offensive rating (109), while the 76ers rank 9th (108). The Sixers rank 2nd in effective field goal percentage (55%), while the Nets rank 5th (53%).

However, where the Sixers have an advantage is on defense. The Sixers rank 3rd in defensive rating (104), while the Nets rank 24th (110). The Sixers also have a much better rebound rate, ranking 4th in rebound percentage (52%), while the Nets rank 18th (47%).

All things considered, I believe that this line is too close to call. However, I do think that the Sixers will win this game outright. They are playing much better basketball right now and have a significant defensive advantage.

#  Boston Celtics vs Brooklyn Nets - Odds, Pick & Prediction

Going into their matchup on Saturday night, the Boston Celtics (14-10) are slight -115 favorites over the Brooklyn Nets (8-17), who come in as +105 underdogs according to OddsShark. The Celtics have won two of their last three games and four of their last six, while the Nets have lost six straight and nine of their last 10.

Boston is unsurprisingly led by Kyrie Irving and Jayson Tatum this season. Irving is averaging 23.9 points and 5.0 assists per game, while Tatum is putting up 16.7 points and 7.0 rebounds per contest. Meanwhile, the Nets’ best player has arguably been Spencer Dinwiddie, who is averaging 18.6 points, 6.5 assists and 3.9 rebounds per game.

The Celtics are a -115 favorite in this game for a few reasons. First, they are at home and have had much more success on their home court than the Nets have had on the road this season. Second, Boston is playing much better basketball lately than Brooklyn is. Finally, Irving and Tatum are a formidable duo that no team wants to go up against.

That being said, the Nets cannot be counted out here as +105 underdogs. They have some good players of their own in Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert, and they could definitely pull off an upset if they catch Boston sleeping or playing down to their competition level. My prediction for this game is a 103-99 victory for the Celtics

The Pistons are 3.5-point favorites in this game, and they have an implied team total of 109.0 points. Andre Drummond is averaging 17.7 points and 15.0 rebounds per game this season, and he is a double-double machine. He has recorded a double-double in 37 out of 41 games this season.

#  What are the symbols in Sugar Skulls game?

The game Sugar Skulls is a new and popular puzzle game. The symbols in this game can be confusing for some players, so here is a guide to help you understand them.

The basic symbols are the skulls, which come in different colors. There are also spiders, flowers, and other objects in the game.

The skulls can be either ordinary skulls or candy skulls. The ordinary skulls are just colored white, pink, or blue. The candy skulls are different colors and they have a sweet wrapper around them.

You need to match three or more of the same type of skull together to clear them from the board. When you do, the symbols on the skulls will disappear and new symbols will fall from the top of the screen.

If you manage to clear all of the symbols from the board, you'll move on to the next level. If not, then one of your precious lives will be lost. You start with three lives, and you can earn more lives by clearing more symbols at once.

The spiders are important because they're like wildcards. They can be matched with any other symbol to create a match. So if you're stuck and don't have any matches available, try matching a spider with another symbol to create a match.

The flowers also have special powers. If you match three or more of them together, they'll bloom and all of the adjacent symbols will change to match their color. This can help you make more matches and clear more symbols from the board.

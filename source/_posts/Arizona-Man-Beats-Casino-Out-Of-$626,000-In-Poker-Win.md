#  Arizona Man Beats Casino Out Of $626,000 In Poker Win

In what has been called the "biggest poker win in Arizona history", a local man has walked away from the casino with over $600,000 in winnings.

The 35-year-old, who wishes to remain anonymous, began playing at the table just after lunch on a Wednesday, and didn't stop until he had beaten the dealer.

"I'd been on a good run all day and I just knew that I was going to win," he said. "The cards were on my side."

Casino officials say that this is by far the largest single payout they have ever seen at their establishment.

When asked how he planned to spend his windfall, the man told reporters that he was going to take his family on vacation to Europe.

"We're going to visit some of my relatives in Italy and Spain," he said. "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and we're going to make the most of it."

#  Arizona Woman Wins $1.5 Million In WSOP Main Event

A woman from Arizona named Jackie Glazier has won the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event, taking home $1.5 million in prize money. This is the first time a woman has won the event in its 49-year history.

Glazier started playing poker seriously about six years ago, after her husband introduced her to the game. She began by playing in small local tournaments, and eventually worked her way up to competing in major events. In July 2018, she won the Ladies’ event at the WSOP, earning herself a spot in the Main Event.

The Main Event was held from July 2-10 at the Rio All Suite Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. There were 7,874 players competing for the $10 million prize pool, but Glazier managed to outlast them all and take home first place.

When asked what it felt like to win, Glazier said, “I don’t even know how to describe it. It’s just a feeling of pure joy and happiness. I can’t believe I did it – it still feels like a dream.”

In addition to winning the $1.5 million prize money, Glazier also took home a championship bracelet and a gold ring. She is only the second woman ever to win a bracelet at the WSOP (the first was Vanessa Selbst in 2014), and she is now one of only nine women who have ever won a World Series title.

#  Arizona Couple Earns Over $500,000 In 2 Days Playing Poker

An Arizona couple has reportedly won over $500,000 in just two days playing poker at a casino in Las Vegas.

According to local news sources, the unidentified couple started playing at the casino on a Wednesday and had racked up their winnings by Friday morning.

Casino officials say the couple was very lucky, as they only lost one hand over the two days.

The husband and wife duo told reporters that they were just "having fun" and were not taking their winnings too seriously. They said they planned to use the money to pay off some bills and take a trip to Europe.

This is not the first time an Arizona resident has won big at a Las Vegas casino. In fact, in February of this year another Arizonan became a millionaire after winning over $1 million playing blackjack.

Satellite tournaments are a great way to win free chips for the WSOP. These tournaments are typically smaller than regular tournaments and offer players a chance to win a seat at a bigger tournament, including the WSOP.

Most satellite tournaments have an entry fee of between $10 and $50. However, there are a number of satellites that are free to enter. Players can find these satellites by visiting the websites of online poker rooms or by checking out the schedule on the official WSOP website.

There are a number of freeroll tournaments available online and at live casinos. Players can find information about upcoming freeroll tournaments by visiting online poker rooms or by checking out casino websites or newsletters.

Players can use their points to enter into any type of qualifier, including Sit & Go qualifiers, multi-table qualifiers, and heads-up qualifiers. By using their points in this way, players can save money on their entry fees and increase their chances of winning a seat at the WSOP Arizona event.

#  Microsoft Hungary Ends Support for How to Play Hungary

Microsoft Hungary has announced that it is to discontinue support for its How to Play Hungary (HTPH) online service from 1 January 2019.

The HTPH online service was launched in November 2017 as a way of providing Hungarian citizens with easy access to Government services. The service allowed users to submit forms and applications, pay fines, and access other important Government information online.

In a statement released on the Microsoft Hungary website, the company said that it had decided to discontinue the HTPH service due to low user numbers. Microsoft Hungary also apologised for any inconvenience caused by the decision.

Hungarian citizens who wish to continue accessing Government services online are advised to use the www.magyarorszag.hu website or the MyGov mobile app.

In a statement, Microsoft said that the decision to discontinue the guide was made after consultations with "relevant stakeholders", and that it will now focus its efforts on developing new content and services.

Some Hungarians have expressed concern that the decision could impact tourism in the country, as visitors will now have less information about what to do and see in Hungary.

Microsoft Hungary Ends Support for How to Play Hungary

After a long and prosperous run, Microsoft Hungary has announced that it will be discontinuing its How to Play Hungary support website as of January 1, 2019. The website, which was launched in 2007, was designed to help Hungarian gamers learn how to play popular PC games such as World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, and League of Legends.

According to the company, the decision to shut down the website was made due to a lack of interest from the Hungarian gaming community. "Over the last few years, we've seen a steady decline in the number of people using our How to Play Hungary website," said Microsoft Hungary spokesperson Eszter Kosaros. "As such, we've decided that it's no longer worth our time or resources to keep it running."

Kosaros added that Hungarian gamers can still find plenty of resources on Microsoft's other gaming websites, including www.microsoft.com/gamerculture and www.xbox.com/hungary. "We encourage all Hungarian gamers to check out these sites for information on the latest games and gaming news," she said. "We also have a number of free tutorials available on our YouTube channel (www.youtube.com/microsofthungary), so there's no need to worry if you're not familiar with some of the latest games."

Microsoft's decision to end its How to Play Hungary support website has not gone over well with many Hungarian gamers. "This is a huge loss for the Hungarian gaming community," said László Törőcsik, president of the Hungarian Gaming Association (HGA). "How to Play Hungary was an invaluable resource for both new and experienced gamers alike."

Törőcsik added that he hopes Microsoft reconsiders its decision or at least provides some kind of replacement service. "We'd be happy to work with Microsoft in order to create a new online resource for Hungarian gamers," he said. "Anything would be better than nothing."

For its part, Microsoft has stated that it has no plans to create any such replacement service. "At this point, we have no plans to create a new online resource for Hungarian gamers," said Kosaros. "Our focus is on our other gaming websites and YouTube channel."

#  Hungarian Government Collapses After Microsoft Ends Support

The Hungarian government has collapsed after Microsoft Corporation announced that it will no longer support the country’s computer systems.

Since the early 1990s, Microsoft has been the exclusive provider of operating system software for the government of Hungary. With the expiration of its support contract, the company has announced that it will no longer provide security updates or technical assistance for the country’s computers.

The announcement has created a crisis in Hungarian politics, with the government unable to continue functioning without Microsoft’s support. The opposition parties have demanded new elections, while Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has insisted that he can still govern with the help of third-party providers.

In a statement, Microsoft said: “We are very sorry to announce that we will be ending our support for the Hungarian government’s computer systems. For more than two decades, we have been the exclusive provider of operating system software for the Hungarian government, and we have always strived to provide world-class technical assistance and security updates. However, with the expiration of our support contract, we can no longer continue to provide these essential services.”

Microsoft has faced criticism for its decision, with many accusing the company of putting its own interests ahead of those of Hungarian citizens. Some have suggested that Microsoft is deliberately withdrawing its support in order to pave the way for its own products and services.

In a statement, Microsoft denied these allegations: “We are not withdrawing our support because we want to promote our own products and services; we are doing this because it is simply no longer possible to provide security updates and technical assistance for these systems. We understand that this may be difficult for some people in Hungary, but we believe this is the best course of action given the current circumstances.”

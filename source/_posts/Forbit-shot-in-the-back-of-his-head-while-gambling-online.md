#  Forbit shot in the back of his head while gambling online

18-year old Forbit Ge was shot in the back of the head while gambling online at an unlicensed website in China’s Guangdong province. Forbit was rushed to the hospital but could not be saved.

Online gambling is illegal in China and is strictly regulated. However, there are many unlicensed websites that still offer gambling services. In recent years, there has been a crackdown on these websites and dozens have been shut down. However, many more remain open, and users often take risks when using them.

Forbit’s death is the latest in a series of tragedies related to online gambling in China. In March, a father and son committed suicide after losing nearly $1 million while gambling online. Last December, a woman died after jumping from a building following losses of over $130,000 while gambling online.

The risks of online gambling are clear. Users can lose large sums of money very quickly, and in some cases, can suffer tragic consequences. Forbit’s death should serve as a warning to all those who gamble online: it is not worth risking your life for the chance to win some money.

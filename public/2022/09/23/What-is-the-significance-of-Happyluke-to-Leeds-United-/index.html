In February 2019, it was announced that Leeds United had agreed a partnership with Happyluke which would see them become the club’s Official Gaming Partner.</p>
<p>The deal is reported to be worth in the region of £1 million and will see Happyluke become the exclusive provider of virtual sports products to Leeds United supporters both in the UK and around the world. The partnership will also see Happyluke become the presenting partner of Leeds United’s Academy, as well as being involved with a number of other marketing and commercial initiatives.</p>
<p>Both parties are understandably delighted with the deal and speaking at its announcement, Peter Watt, Executive Director at Leeds United said: </p>
<p>“We are really pleased to have agreed this partnership with HappyLuke. They are a global brand with a strong presence in Asia and we believe they can bring real value to our fans across the world. As part of our plans for Leeds United’s growth we are always looking for new ways to engage with our huge international fanbase and this partnership provides an excellent opportunity to do that.”<br>HappyLuke CEO Fanny Law added: </p>
<p>“Leeds United is one of the biggest football clubs in Europe with an incredibly passionate fan base. We’re really excited to be partnering with them and look forward to working together on some innovative projects that will excite fans all over the world.” </p>

<h1 id="How-did-Eliot-come-to-be-associated-with-both-teams"><a href="#How-did-Eliot-come-to-be-associated-with-both-teams" class="headerlink" title="How did Eliot come to be associated with both teams?"></a>How did Eliot come to be associated with both teams?</h1><p>It is often said that the poet T.S. Eliot was a lifelong fan of both the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees. How did this come to be?</p>
<p>Born in St. Louis in 1888, Eliot spent his formative years in Massachusetts. He attended Harvard University, where he became good friends with future Baseball Hall of Fame member George H.W. Bush. It was during his time at Harvard that Eliot developed his love for both the Red Sox and the Yankees.</p>
<p>After graduation, Eliot moved to England, where he would eventually become one of the most important writers of the 20th century. While he was living in England, the Red Sox and Yankees enjoyed a fierce rivalry, with each team winning multiple World Series titles. Eliot followed both teams closely and was often quoted discussing his love for them both.</p>
<p>In 1965, Eliot returned to the United States for a visit. He was honored by both the Red Sox and Yankees with special ceremonies at Fenway Park and Yankee Stadium. After his death in 1965, Eliot was buried between two baseball stadiums – Fenway Park in Boston and Yankee Stadium in New York.</p>
<p>So why did Eliot come to be associated with both teams? Some say it was because of his friendship with George H.W. Bush, while others say it was because of his love for the fierce rivalry between the two teams. Whatever the reason, it’s clear that Eliot will always be linked with both the Red Sox and Yankees</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-nature-of-the-relationship-between-Happyluke-and-Leeds-United"><a href="#What-is-the-nature-of-the-relationship-between-Happyluke-and-Leeds-United" class="headerlink" title="What is the nature of the relationship between Happyluke and Leeds United?"></a>What is the nature of the relationship between Happyluke and Leeds United?</h1><p>Happyluke has been the main shirt sponsor of Leeds United since the beginning of the 2016&#x2F;17 season. The sponsorship agreement is reported to be worth £1 million per year.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this is a strong and beneficial relationship for both parties involved. Leeds United get much-needed financial backing, while Happyluke receives significant exposure and association with a well-known football club.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there was some speculation in the press early on in the relationship that Happyluke might take over Leeds United altogether. However, this proved to be unfounded and the two clubs have continued to operate independently.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the relationship between Happyluke and Leeds United remains a close one and looks set to continue for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-Eliot-so-important-to-both-teams"><a href="#Why-is-Eliot-so-important-to-both-teams" class="headerlink" title="Why is Eliot so important to both teams?"></a>Why is Eliot so important to both teams?</h1><p>One of the most hotly debated questions in the world of sports is what player is the most important to their team. Is it the superstar? The captain? The quarterback? Or someone else entirely? In the NFL, there are a number of players who could lay claim to the title of most important. For the New England Patriots, it’s undoubtedly quarterback Tom Brady. And for the Los Angeles Rams, it’s definitely running back Todd Gurley.</p>
<p>But there’s one player who is essential to both teams, and that’s poet T.S. Eliot. Yes, you read that correctly. The author of “The Waste Land” and other seminal works is just as important to Patriots fans as he is to Rams fans. How can this be?</p>
<p>Well, let’s start with the Rams. As many football fans know, Gurley is an absolute force on the field. He led the NFL in yards from scrimmage in 2017 and was named Offensive Player of the Year. But as good as he is, he wouldn’t be nearly as successful without offensive coordinator Sean McVay calling plays for him. McVay is considered one of (if not THE) best coaches in the NFL, and his ability to get the most out of Gurley is a big reason why Los Angeles has made it to two consecutive Super Bowls.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn our attention to the Patriots. As great as Tom Brady is, he isn’t a one-man show. He has some of the best receivers in the league at his disposal, including Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski. But Brady would be nothing without head coach Bill Belichick calling plays for him. Belichick has more Super Bowl rings than any other head coach in NFL history, and much of that success can be attributed to his incredible understanding of offensive game plans.</p>
<p>So while Tom Brady and Todd Gurley are certainly essential players for their respective teams, they wouldn’t be nearly as successful without Eliot!</p>
<h1 id="How-did-Eliot-come-to-be-known-as-the-Leeds-United-x2F-Happyluke-jinx"><a href="#How-did-Eliot-come-to-be-known-as-the-Leeds-United-x2F-Happyluke-jinx" class="headerlink" title="How did Eliot come to be known as the Leeds United&#x2F;Happyluke jinx?"></a>How did Eliot come to be known as the Leeds United&#x2F;Happyluke jinx?</h1><p>The story of how Eliot the Leeds United&#x2F;Happyluke jinx came to be is a curious one. The story goes that a young man by the name of Eliot was walking through Leeds one day, when he came across a group of boys playing football. Eliot decided to join in, and his skills were evident from the start. He scored every goal, and the other boys soon began calling him ‘the jinx’.</p>
<p>This new moniker followed Eliot wherever he went, and it wasn’t long before it reached the ears of the Leeds United football team. The players were curious to meet the boy who had such a commanding presence on the pitch, and they soon invited him to come and train with them.</p>
<p>Eliot continued to play impressively for Leeds United, but disaster always seemed to follow him. No matter how well he played, the team would always lose in the end. Fans started calling him ‘the jinx’ in earnest, and soon everyone knew about his bad luck streak.</p>
<p>The final straw came when Eliot was signed up by Happyluke online casino as their official spokesperson. Happyluke had high hopes that Eliot’s good fortune would rub off on them, but their luck didn’t change. In fact, things only seemed to get worse for Happyluke whenever Eliot was involved.</p>
<p>The press began calling Eliot ‘the Leeds United&#x2F;Happyluke jinx’, and the moniker has stuck with him ever since. Despite his many failings, Eliot has never lost his sense of humor or his ability to make people laugh. He is still known today as one of the funniest footballers in history!</p>

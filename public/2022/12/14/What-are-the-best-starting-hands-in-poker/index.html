        <h1 id="What-are-the-best-starting-hands-in-poker"><a href="#What-are-the-best-starting-hands-in-poker" class="headerlink" title="What are the best starting hands in poker?"></a>What are the best starting hands in poker?</h1><p>There is no definitive answer to this question, as the best starting hand in poker depends on the exact variant of the game being played, and the particular situation. However, there are some hands that are generally considered to be more powerful than others, and understanding these hands is a key part of becoming a successful poker player.</p>
<p>In general, the strongest hands in poker are those that contain a combination of high cards and pairs. Aces and kings are both strong hands, as they contain two high cards each. Pairs such as queens and jacks are also very desirable, as they give players the chance to make two separate winning hands. Other powerful combinations include three-of-a-kind and a straight flush.</p>
<p>While it is important to know which hands are strong, it is also important to be aware of which hands are weak. In general, hands that contain low cards or no pairs are weak, as there is a higher chance that these hands will not win any substantial pots. It is therefore important for players to be aggressive when holding these weaker hands, in order to bluff other players into folding.</p>
<p> Understanding which starting hands are strong and which ones are weak is an essential part of becoming a successful poker player. By knowing which hands to play and which ones to fold, players can increase their chances of winning pots and making profits at the table.</p>
<h1 id="Top-10-starting-hands-for-poker"><a href="#Top-10-starting-hands-for-poker" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 starting hands for poker"></a>Top 10 starting hands for poker</h1><p>There is no one perfect starting hand in poker, but there are certainly hands that are better than others. Here are the top 10 starting hands for poker, ranked in order from best to worst:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Aces: Aces are the best possible starting hand in poker, and should always be played if you have them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Kings: Kings are a very strong hand and should also be played whenever you have them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Queens: Queens are another very strong hand, and should be played whenever possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jacks: Jacks are a good starting hand, but not quite as strong as the hands listed above. They should still be played whenever possible, however.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tens: Tens are a decent starting hand, and can be played in most situations. However, they are not as strong as some of the other hands on this list.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nines: Nines are another decent starting hand, but they are not as strong as the hands listed above. They can often be played safely, however.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Eights: Eights are not a particularly strong hand, but they can still be playable in some situations. It is generally advisable to fold if you don’t have anything else to work with though.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sevens: Sevens are not a great starting hand, but they can still be playable in some cases. You should usually fold if you don’t have anything else to work with, however.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sixes: Sixes are not a great starting hand by any means, and you should generally fold if you don’t have anything else to work with.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>10 (tie). Fives: Fives are not a particularly strong starting hand, but they can still be playable in some cases. You should usually fold if you don’t have anything else to work with, however</p>
<h1 id="New-good-starting-hands-in-poker"><a href="#New-good-starting-hands-in-poker" class="headerlink" title="New good starting hands in poker"></a>New good starting hands in poker</h1><p>There are a number of “new good starting hands” in poker that you should be aware of. Some of these hands used to be considered relatively weak, but they have now become much more powerful due to changes in the way the game is played.</p>
<p>Here are four of the best new starting hands in poker:</p>
<p>#1) Ace-King</p>
<p>The Ace-King has always been a strong hand, but it has become even more powerful in today’s poker games. This hand can be played aggressively and is very difficult for your opponents to beat.</p>
<p>#2) Big pairs (aces, kings, queens, etc.)</p>
<p>Big pairs have always been strong hands in poker, but they have become even more important in today’s games. These hands can often win you the pot without even having to showdown!</p>
<p>#3) Suited connectors (6-7s, 8-9s, etc.)</p>
<p>Suited connectors are hands that are connected like 6-7s or 8-9s. They used to be considered weak hands, but they are now much more powerful because they can easily make straights and flushes.</p>
<p>#4) Mid pairs (10s and below)</p>
<p>Mid pairs have also become much more powerful in recent years. These hands used to be considered relatively weak, but they can now win you a lot of pots if played correctly.</p>
